Finally, this website is not a centered text on pink background anymore.

In all seriousness, I want this blog to be a showcase of my work over the years, a collection of my thoughts, and maybe some other stuff I haven't come up with yet. I've been wanting to make this for a long time, and only now I finally decided to make it.

Over the years I've tried out multiple various languages, libraries and frameworks, but ultimately ended up using Hugo with Stack theme, because of the simplicity of building and deploying a website with Hugo and also I saw the Stack theme on [mrparker's website](https://mrparker.dev/) and decided to use it myself.

Hopefully this blog and the ability to publicly showcase my projects will give me more motivation to work on projects.
